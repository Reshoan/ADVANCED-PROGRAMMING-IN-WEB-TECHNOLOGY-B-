Next js is a react framework.
Next is quite fast.
It seperates server side and client side.


pace.tsx generates layout.tsx and makes pace.tsx a child for that page.

Will a layout.psx be created for home folder in src/app/?
In Next.js 13+ (with the **App Router**), yes — each folder inside the `src/app` directory **can** (but doesn't have to) include its own `layout.tsx` file.

Here’s how it works:

### 📁 Structure Example

```bash
src/
└── app/
    ├── layout.tsx          ← Root layout (required)
    ├── page.tsx            ← Root page
    └── home/
        ├── page.tsx        ← Renders your "hello" text
        └── layout.tsx      ← Optional, specific layout for /home
```

### 🔍 So, to answer your question:

No, **a `layout.tsx` file is not automatically created** in `home/`. You have to create it manually **if** you want a separate layout for that route.

If you **don’t** add a `layout.tsx` in `home/`, the `home/page.tsx` will just use the **nearest parent layout**, which would be the root `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Would you like help writing a `layout.tsx` file for `home/` that wraps your "hello" message?
